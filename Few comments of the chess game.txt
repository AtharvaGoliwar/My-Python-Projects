## Check and Checkmate 
    ## Get the position of the king
    ## Then get all the possible directions from which it can be attacked
        ## This can be done by iterating through grids in all directions, then check for white piece in the respective direction, and then if any black piece before it, block it 
        ## And only show few grids where king can go


## Future Updates:
## Show the moves history on right side telling at what move which piece went where or captured other piece
    ##BUT BRO TRY THIS AFTER YOUR JEE AND BITSAT
    ##To show history, save each move on a database and show that move on the right of the screen. 
    ##Aloing with the coordinates, save the whole "coords" list at that row
    ##After the game if we click at particular move, the situation of that move can be shown with that coords list
